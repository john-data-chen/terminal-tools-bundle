# Config of fish shell and starship prompt

- [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)
- [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/)
- [starship](https://starship.rs/)

I chose them because they are lightweight, fast, and powerful.

- Kitty is a fast, feature-rich, GPU based terminal.
- Fish is a smart and user-friendly command line shell for Linux, macOS.
- Starship is minimal, blazing-fast, and infinitely customizable prompt for any shell, which can display git status, git branch, and Node.JS version...etc
